            <h2>The Pitch</h2>
            <p>Let's be blunt. Streaming in Australia is a fractured, overpriced scam.</p>
            <p>You're paying a fortune to scroll through ten different apps, trying to remember which service has that one show, all while another price hike email lands in your inbox. These digital landlords sell your viewing data, force-feed you ads, and lock you into their "ecosystems."</p>
            <p><strong>They own your screen. It's time to take it back.</strong></p>
            <p>The Pigeon is the master key. We take a beast of a media player, flash it with a completely custom, Australia-centric build of Kodi, and configure it to work straight out of the box. No tech headaches. No bullshit.</p>
            <p>Plug it in, and everything is there. One interface, one search, zero restrictions. This isn't just hardware; it's a statement. It's your media, finally uncaged. And with the included 12-month access to the MZ1312 private feed, your box stays updated with the best tools, maintained by us.</p>

            <h2>Here's The Damn Point (Features)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Zero F*cking Around.</strong> Unbox it. Plug in two cables. It works. The setup is streamlined for the typical Aussie home, ready to go in minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Built for Australia.</strong> Our custom Kodi build is stable, fast, and tailored for what Aussies watch. We're a multicultural nation, so we made a multicultural box. Need content in Vietnamese, Greek, Arabic, or Italian? Tell us when you order. Done.</li>
                <li><strong>Truly Yours. Uncaged.</strong> No corporate spyware tracking what you watch. No selling your data. No being locked out of your own hardware. Your box, your rules.</li>
                <li><strong>The Private Feed.</strong> Get 12 months of included access to the private MZ1312 repository. We handle the software updates and curate the best community add-ons so your device stays sharp and ahead of the curve.</li>
                <li><strong>Silent & Powerful.</strong> It’s small, it’s quiet, and it packs more than enough punch to handle anything you throw at it.</li>
            </ul>
